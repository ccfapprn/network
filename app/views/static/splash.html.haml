      %h2 IBD Patients and Researchers:  A Revolutionary Partnership
    %br/
    %p CCFA Partners is an innovative network where patients and researchers work together to find better treatments for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) by looking beyond the doctor’s office.  If you’re a patient with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, managing your condition can affect the way you live your life, from the food you eat to where and when you socialize with friends.  With easy-to-use tracking tools, you’ll gain better control over your own health while shaping and supporting groundbreaking research that uses new ways to look for a cure.  Help us learn how IBD affects your life in order to make it better.

    %h2 Research That Answers Questions You Care About
    %p.lead
      %em “I am very excited to be involved with CCFA Partners because it is completely focused on patient reported outcomes. For the first time, we have a study that is exclusively asking the questions that people with IBD care about – diet, sleep, fatigue, quality of life. The answers to these questions will allow us to provide better care.” - Dr. Robert Sandler, researcher
