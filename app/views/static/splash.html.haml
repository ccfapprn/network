            “This new research model really is a game changer. For the first time, patients are involved at every step of the way; from overseeing the research process, to being participants in studies. By being involved in this new research paradigm, I am empowered, and really believe I am helping shape the future of IBD.”

            “I am very excited to be involved with CCFA Partners because it is completely focused on patient reported outcomes. For the first time, we have a study that is exclusively asking the questions that people with IBD care about – diet, sleep, fatigue, quality of life. The answers to these questions will allow us to provide better care.”
