    %p Our advocates are not only patients, but family members, friends, caregivers, and doctors who want to make their voices heard in Congress and see a future free from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. We've already achieved great success in urging our legislators to implement responsible policies that can transform the lives of Americans living with inflammatory bowel diseases. With your help, we can accomplish even more. Join our Advocacy Network and take action today.
