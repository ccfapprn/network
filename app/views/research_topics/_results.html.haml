          Prevalence of Gluten Free Diet and Symptom Improvement in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in CCFA Partners Cohort:
        Presentation Date: Dec 12-14, 2013

    %p Patients with celiac disease (an autoimmune disorder where eating gluten can damage the small intestine) benefit from a gluten free diet (GFD). Few data are available to tell us if patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) may also benefit from this diet. Individuals with GI symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue and nausea can have non-celiac gluten sensitivity, for which a GFD can be beneficial. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity can also co-exist with IBD. We therefore asked patients enrolled in CCFA Partners whether they have ever tried a gluten free diet (GFD), whether they followed this diet closely, and whether it helped with any symptoms. A total of 1647 people took the survey on GFD. A total of 314 (19.1%) reported that they had ever tried a GFD and 135 (8.1%) were currently following the diet. Overall, 206/314 (65.6%) trying a GFD reported improvement in any GI symptom while on this diet. Over a 1/3 of people (38.3%) felt that they experienced fewer or less severe flares while on the diet. Improvements in clinical symptoms were reported for bloating (56.5%), diarrhea (42.6%), abdominal pain (41.5%), fatigue (27.5%), and nausea (26.3%) while on a GFD. Fatigue was significantly improved with excellent adherence to the diet. Because many patients had improved symptoms on the GFD, it is possible that patients with IBD could suffer from non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Fewer people who felt better on a GFD were taking biologics medications, suggesting that flare symptoms in those with more severe disease may not respond to a GFD. Future studies are needed to understand the benefits of this diet in IBD patients, and the mechanism of improvement with this dietary intervention.

          Behavioral Strategies to Improve Cohort Retention within CCFA Partners.
        Presentation Date: Dec 12-14, 2013
    %p Earlier studies have shown that people who participate in surveys (such as CCFA Partners) may respond better to survey requests if these have a time limit (such as telling participants that surveys need to be done in 72 hours). This is called "scarcity." Other ways to improve survey response include messages targeting: paying it forward (that what you are doing will help people in the future), guilt, altruism (helping others), and self-serving (helping yourself). Our goal was to see if scarcity or these messages improved response rates within CCFA Partners. The scarcity group received a 'warning' email informing them that they will be sent a survey link the next day, and that they will have 72 hours to complete the survey. The control group received no warning email. We also tested the four different messages described above and a "control" message that just informed patients that it was time for their survey. We sent emails to a total of 8697 people within CCFA Partners asking them to complete their follow-up surveys. Of these, 2965 started their follow up survey. There was no difference between those in the 'scarcity group' as compared to control group. Scarcity was, however, more effective in the >50 age group. Of the messages, guilt resulted in a significantly higher response rate, while the other messages were no different than control. In summary, behavioral interventions applied to an internet-based IBD cohort have little benefit in improving response rates. Guilt had the strongest effect. The reasons that the other messages did not work may be that these interventions don't apply in an IBD population, that e-mail messages are not as effective, or that members of CCFA Partners are already very motivated to fill out surveys.

          Perceptions of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Patients on Biobanking in the CCFA Partners Cohort.
        Presentation Date: Dec 12-14, 2013
    %p A biobank is a collection of samples from patients (including spit, stool or blood). Biobanks are very important for understanding risk factors for developing disease or for severity of disease. We wanted to understand more about why patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) would or would not participate in a biobank. We first did a series of interviews over the phone with patients who were participating in the CCFA Partners study. This helped us to understand the important concerns about biobanks and develop a survey for use in CCFA Partners. We then sent a survey to over 800 people with IBD in CCFA Partners. We did a total of 26 phone interviews. Patients doing the interviews told us that they had concerns about how samples would be collected/stored; who would be allowed access; whether these samples would be used for other things (not only research); and whether this would affect whether they could get life insurance. Most people were not that worried about using the blood for genetic studies. People thought that that biobanks were important for research, that they might lead to a cure; that by donating they would be helping others or family members with IBD; and hoped that they might personally benefit, although most understood that they likely would not. These themes aided in the development of a survey instrument to assess perceptions of biobanking. A total of 476 people initially finished the survey. Almost 40% said that they would 'definitely yes' donate samples, 56.0% would 'probably yes' donate, 5.1% 'probably no' and 0.7% 'definitely no'. There were no factors that made someone more likely to donate (reported donation rates were not different for Crohn's disease (CD) versus ulcerative colitis (UC), remission versus active disease, or education level. People were most willing to donate spit, followed by blood and lastly stool. Knowing these important thoughts on sample donation/biobanks will help researchers to develop consents for IBD biobanks and design educational materials on biobanks for IBD patients.

          Development of CCFA Partners Kids & Teens: an Internet-Based Cohort of Pediatric IBD.
        Presentation Date: Dec 12-14, 2013
    %p After the successful launch of CCFA Partners for adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease, the kids and teens component (CCFA Partners Kids & Teens) started in 2013. In partnership with the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), children <18 years of age were asked to join the internet-based study through email invitations and promotion on social media sites. After informed consent, the children and their parents completed surveys asking questions about their disease, their medications and other patient reported outcomes (such as quality of life, fatigue, sleep, peer relations, mood, etc). In the first month, 419 children joined. The average age was 13, with about 1/2 being female and about 3/4 having Crohn's disease (CD). Common medications used by patients with CD were biologics, thiopurines (6mp or azathioprine) or mesalamine-based medications (Pentasa, Lialda, Apriso, etc). The most common medication for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) was mesalamine-based medications. Most of the CD patients were in remission and most UC patients had mild disease. Children who had active disease had more depression and anxiety. Following this group of children over time will help us to learn a great deal about living with IBD as a child, and will allow us to follow these children into adulthood to learn even more about the disease itself, the impact of medications, and how symptoms change over time.

          Role of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs in Exacerbations of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
        Presentation Date: Oct 11-16, 2013
    %p Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, medications such as Advil, ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.) may cause GI inflammation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD patients are often told to avoid these medications. We looked at patients in CCFA Partners in who were in remission (with few to no symptoms) and asked about regular NSAID use. We then looked at whether they flared 6 months later. A total of 791 patients were included, of these, 40.6% reported ever using NSAIDS at baseline. Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) who regularly used NSAIDS (? 5 times/monthly) had a 65% increased risk of later flare. No effect of regular NSAID use was seen for ulcerative colitis (UC). Those with CD who used acetaminophen (Tylenol) also had a 72% increased risk of later flare. Lower doses of NSAIDs had no association with flare. Therefore, regular NSAID use or acetaminophen use may increase the risk of flare in CD, but not UC. This may be related to effects of the medications. It is also possible that those people with IBD who require pain medications at baseline may not be in as full a remission, which may increase the risk of later flare.

          Validation of an Internet-Based Cohort of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (CCFA Partners).
        Presentation Date: May 21, 2013
    %p CCFA Partners is an internet cohort of patients with self-reported inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. In this study, investigators obtained medical records from the doctors treating 99 participants to confirm that they do have IBD. Doctors confirmed IBD diagnosis in 97% of the participants, and confirmed disease type (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) in 97% of those with IBD. These findings support the use of self-reported IBD in CCFA Partners.

          Inflammatory Bowel Disease Symptom Severity is Influenced by Hormone Fluctuations in Many Women with IBD.
        Presentation Date: May 19, 2013
    %p In a study of over 1200 females with inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, more than half reported worsening disease symptoms during menstrual periods. Women who reported worse symptoms during menses were younger than those who did not. About 10% said that hormonal contraceptive agents improved their symptoms, but about 8% said that hormonal contraceptive agents made their symptoms worse. Among women who had reached menopause, an older age of IBD onset was associated with worse symptoms after menopause. This study shows that symptom severity is influenced during times of hormone changes in many women with IBD and that duration of IBD may play a role in hormonally mediated symptoms.

          Symptom Worsening During Pregnancy and Lactation is Associated with Age, Body Mass Index, and Disease Phenotype in Women with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
        Presentation Date: May 19, 2013
    %p In a study of over 300 women with inflammatory bowel disease who reported at least one pregnancy after their IBD diagnosis, more than half reported that their disease symptoms improved during pregnancy, while about 20% said that their disease symptoms were worse during pregnancy. Younger women and women with ulcerative colitis were more likely to have increased disease symptoms during pregnancy. Of the nearly 200 women who breastfed, 14% said that symptoms improved, 13% said symptoms got worse and about 40% said their symptoms did not change during breastfeeding Those with worsening symptoms during breastfeeding were younger and had a lower body mass index than those whose symptoms remained the same or improved.

          Sleep Disturbance and Risk of Relapse in Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis.
        Presentation Date: May 19, 2013
    %p People with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, tend to have poor quality of sleep. In this study of over 3000 people with IBD, those with more disease activity, depression, female gender, a history of smoking, or those currently taking corticosteroids or narcotics were more likely to have sleep disturbance. Of people with Crohn's disease who were in remission at the beginning of the study, those with sleep disturbance were twice as likely to have a flare in 6 months. No effect was seen for ulcerative colitis. These results suggest that sleep is important for maintaining remission in IBD.

          Association Between Exercise and Future Flares in an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Population in Remission.
        Presentation Date: May 18, 2013
    %p In a study of over 1300 people with inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, who were in clinical remission, those who exercised more at the beginning of the study were less likely to have active disease after 6 months. This effect was seen regardless of health status at the beginning of the study, including age and smoking status. These results show that exercise may protect against disease activity in IBD. One other explanation for this finding is that patients with very well controlled disease are better able to exercise. If these results are found in other studies, exercise could be recommended to improve disease symptoms in IBD.

    %p Patient-reported outcomes, or PROs, can give useful information to doctors and researchers about patient health. In a study of over 7000 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, PROs showed that IBD patients had more anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep disturbance, and less social satisfaction than the general population. Using corticosteroids made all of the outcomes worse. These results showed that IBD patients, like patients with other chronic illnesses, were lower functioning than the general population.

          Dietary Patterns and Self Reported Associations of Diet with Symptoms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease
        Presentation Dates: May 19-23, 2012
    %p There are many different dietary recommendations available for patients with inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, but there is no good evidence to support any specific recommendations. Over 4000 patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis took a survey about the types of food they frequently eat. Patients said that fruits and non-leafy vegetables were most likely to make their symptoms better, but fruits and non-leafy vegetables were also the most likely to make their symptoms worse. The researchers believe that the symptoms reported may be from intolerance to specific foods rather than inflammation from IBD.

          Status of Prevention in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases within the CCFA Partners Cohort
        Presentation Dates: Dec 1-3, 2011
    %p Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, may be more likely to develop weak bones, infections like influenza and tuberculosis and certain cancers of the skin, cervix and colon, depending on the type of medications they use. Fortunately, there are simple activities that can prevent these from occurring. In a survey of over 7000 patients with IBD, only about half had a bone density scan or took calcium or vitamin D supplements to promote bone health. Only 40% reported having a skin exam and 16% reported always wearing sunscreen to prevent skin cancer. Less than two thirds had an influenza (flu) vaccine. These results show that not enough patients are doing simple activities to prevent weak bones, infections and cancers that may be related to IBD.

          Prevalence of a Gluten-free Diet and Improvement of Clinical Symptoms in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.
        Publication Date: July 2014
    %p Patients with celiac disease (an autoimmune disorder where eating gluten can damage the small intestine) benefit from a gluten free diet (GFD). Few data are available to tell us if patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) may also benefit from this diet. Individuals with GI symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue and nausea can have non-celiac gluten sensitivity, for which a GFD can be beneficial. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity can also co-exist with IBD. We therefore asked patients enrolled in CCFA Partners whether they have ever tried a gluten free diet (GFD), whether they followed this diet closely, and whether it helped with any symptoms. A total of 1647 people took the survey on GFD. A total of 314 (19.1%) reported that they had ever tried a GFD and 135 (8.1%) were currently following the diet. Overall, 206/314 (65.6%) trying a GFD reported improvement in any GI symptom while on this diet. Over a 1/3 of people (38.3%) felt that they experienced fewer or less severe flares while on the diet. Improvements in clinical symptoms were reported for bloating (56.5%), diarrhea (42.6%), abdominal pain (41.5%), fatigue (27.5%), and nausea (26.3%) while on a GFD. Fatigue was significantly improved with excellent adherence to the diet. Because many patients had improved symptoms on the GFD, it is possible that patients with IBD could suffer from non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Fewer people who felt better on a GFD were taking biologics medications, suggesting that flare symptoms in those with more severe disease may not respond to a GFD. Future studies are needed to understand the benefits of this diet in IBD patients, and the mechanism of improvement with this dietary intervention.

          Validation of an Internet-based Cohort of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CCFA Partners).
        Publication Date: 2014
    %p CCFA Partners is an internet cohort of patients with self-reported inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. In this study, investigators obtained medical records from the doctors treating 99 participants to confirm that they do have IBD. Doctors confirmed IBD diagnosis in 97% of the participants, and confirmed disease type (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) in 97% of those with IBD. These findings support the use of self-reported IBD in CCFA Partners.

          Immunization Rates and Vaccine Beliefs Among Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An Opportunity for Improvement.
        Publication Date: 2013
    %p Treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, puts patients at risk of other infections, like influenza or the "flu", which could be prevented by vaccines. In a study of nearly 1000 patients with IBD, not enough said they were getting the vaccines they needed. Patients with a primary care physician and those taking immunosuppressive medications were more likely to get vaccines. The researchers recommend educating patients and encouraging gastroenterologists to ask and counsel patients on vaccines.

          Evaluation of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System in a Large Cohort of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.
        Publication Date: October 29, 2013 [Epub ahead of print]
    %p Patient-reported outcomes, or PROs, can give useful information to doctors and researchers about patient health. In a study of over 7000 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, PROs showed that IBD patients had more anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep disturbance, and less social satisfaction than the general population. Using corticosteroids made all of the outcomes worse. These results showed that IBD patients, like patients with other chronic illnesses, were lower functioning than the general population.

          Sleep Disturbance and Risk of Active Disease in Patients With Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis.
        Publication Date: August 2013
    %p People with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, tend to have poor quality of sleep. In this study of over 3000 people with IBD, those with more disease activity, depression, female gender, a history of smoking, or those currently taking corticosteroids or narcotics were more likely to have sleep disturbance. Of people with Crohn's disease who were in remission at the beginning of the study, those with sleep disturbance were twice as likely to have a flare in 6 months. No effect was seen for ulcerative colitis. These results suggest that sleep is important for maintaining remission in IBD.

          Risk Factors for Depression in the Elderly Inflammatory Bowel Disease Population. Journal of Crohn's and Colitis.
        Published Date: July 2013
    %p Depression is common among patients with inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. This study showed that as many as 1 in 4 elderly patients with IBD may suffer from depression. Depressed elderly patients with IBD were more likely to have more severe disease activity. They were also less likely to take their medication correctly all of the time.

          Patient Perception of Chronic Illness Care in a Large Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort.
        Publication Date: June 2013
    %p Like many other chronic illnesses, there is inconsistent quality of health care for inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. In this study, nearly 1000 patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis took a survey about their experiences with chronic illness care, including questions about goal setting, problem solving and follow-up. Patients who had a recent gastroenterologist visit, hospitalization, surgery, or currently had a pouch or ostomy, reported having higher quality of care. Patients with higher quality of care also reported better quality of life.

          Dietary Patterns and Self-Reported Associations of Diet with Symptoms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
        Publication Date: Aug 26, 2012
    %p People with inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, often say that specific foods make their symptoms better or worse, but there is no good scientific evidence to support a specific diet. In this study, nearly 7,000 patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative completed a survey about the their diet and IBD symptoms. Yogurt and rice were most often reported to improve symptoms. Vegetables, fruit, spicy foods, fried foods, milk, red meat, soda, popcorn, dairy, alcohol, high fiber foods, fatty foods, seeds, coffee and beans were most frequently reported to worsen symptoms. In general, patients with ulcerative colitis ate more fruit, vegetables, beans and popcorn than patients with Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease patients with an ostomy tended to eat more cheese, sweetened beverages, milk, pizza and processed meats than Crohn's disease without an ostomy.

          Development of an Internet-based Cohort of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (CCFA Partners): Methodology and Initial Results. 
        Publication Date: Jan 27, 2012
    %p This manuscript describes the creation of CCFA Partners and the first 7,819 participants. Of the people who took the first surveys, 72% were women, the median age was 42 years, 63% had Crohn's disease, 34% had ulcerative colitis and 3% had other IBD. CCFA Partners is a unique resource to study patient outcomes and satisfaction, quality of care and changes in disease management over time.
