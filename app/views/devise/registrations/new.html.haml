      As a member, we’ll ask you for information about what it’s like to live with IBD. We’ll also request that you complete surveys every six months and connect your mobile health applications (if you want). You’ll even be able to suggest and vote on research questions and track your health over time.
    %p
      We’ll always protect the information you give us and respect your time. We’ll prioritize the research questions that are important to you and update you on the progress of research and what’s discovered. Your participation can make a big difference. Let’s work to find better treatments for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis together.
