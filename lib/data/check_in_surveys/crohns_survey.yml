# If you make any material changes to a survey, you should create a new one with a new version number so old answers stay tied to their old version.
# If you do not update the version number and make changes, it will update the survey info on the existing survey in the DB --
# this is a good idea if your changes were immaterial (ie. just to the title or description)
# run "rake check_ins:update" after you've made changes to any of these yml files
